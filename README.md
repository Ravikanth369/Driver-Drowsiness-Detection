# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Repository Name: Driver Drowsiness Detection System 
Description: This project implements a driver drowsiness detection system using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system is designed to enhance road safety by monitoring drivers in real-time and detecting signs of drowsiness or fatigue. 


The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to analyze facial landmarks, focusing specifically on the driver’s eyes. The model classifies whether the driver’s eyes are open or closed, and based on this analysis, determines their level of alertness. The project achieves a detection accuracy of 90% and is optimized to process video frames in under 0.5 seconds, enabling seamless real-time performance.

Key features include:

Real-Time Monitoring: Captures video from a webcam or camera and detects the driver’s face and eyes.
Drowsiness Detection: Analyzes the state of the driver’s eyes (open/closed) using a CNN-based machine learning model.
Alert System: Provides immediate alerts (e.g., sound or visual) when signs of fatigue are detected to ensure timely corrective action.
High Performance: Reduces the risk of false negatives and processes frames quickly for uninterrupted real-time monitoring.
The project is implemented using Python and leverages libraries like OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for building and training the CNN model. Additional libraries such as NumPy and Pandas are used for data handling and preprocessing.

This system has wide applications, including road safety for individual drivers, fleet management in logistics, and as a safety feature in semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles. The system can also be integrated with in-car safety mechanisms for commercial use.

The repository is a practical project for those interested in AI-powered safety systems, real-time computer vision applications, and intelligent driver monitoring solutions. The project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to solve critical real-world problems and make transportation safer.
